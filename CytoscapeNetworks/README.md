## Cytoscape Regulatory Network Visualization
To view the regulatory networks, you must first install cytoscape: https://cytoscape.org/download_old_versions.html
We recommend downloading version 3.10.1 as this was the version used for visualization. Once you have Cytoscape installed, simply load in any of the saved cytoscape session files located in the CytoscapeNetworks folder.
